Context:

This was a university project, where we had to get and use a dataset to analysis and visualize the data to find patterns. it was divided into 2 projects, 
where in the second one we get to gather more data using scrapping or other sources and using that data to set hypotheses and verify them.

Description:

The dataset provides comprehensive information on causes of death worldwide from the year 2000 to 2019 to work only on data from last 2 decades,
to avoid working on older data which might cause historical outliers. It includes data on death rates and causes categorized by various countries. 
The dataset includes a wide range of causes of death including infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, external causes such as accidents and violence, and natural disasters. 
The goal of using this dataset is to find patterns in the causes of death to help researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals identify areas of importance, 
evaluate the efficacy of public health campaigns, and develop strategies to lower mortality rates. 
We have further divided the data between Chronic, Non-chronic illnesses and other factors, to help pinpoint more trends in our data and help analyze it in a more comprehensive matter. 

In Project 2, we have set a hypothesis that pollution plays a major role in most illness factors and some of the other factors. 
We are collecting data that shows the amount of PM2.5, which refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less. 
These particles are extremely small and can be composed of various substances such as; dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. 
PM2.5 particles are an issue because of their tiny size, which allows them to penetrate deep into the respiratory system when inhaled and affects all aspects of our health.
Furthermore, PM2.5 pollution not only affects human health but also has adverse effects on the environment. It can impair visibility, 
contribute to acid rain, and harm ecosystems by depositing harmful substances onto soil and water bodies and affect weather patterns and temperature as it contributes to climate change.
The data was already collected during this phase through scrapping and merging the data, and we will be exploring our findings during this document through visualization insights.
